/** The state of a Blocks puzzle, which consists of a rectangular grid
 *  of cells, plus a set of pieces, called the "hand".  The cells have
 *  0-based column and row numbers, and each contains the value true or
 *  false, indicating whether it is currently filled (true) or empty (false).
 *  Rows are numbered from the top (row 0) down, and columns from left to
 *  right. Methods allow querying the contents of the cells,
 *  adding pieces to the hand, moving pieces from the hand to the board,
 *  determining whether a puzzle piece may be added at a given position or
 *  anywhere, and undoing or redoing moves.
